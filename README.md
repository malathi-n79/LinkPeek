# 🔗 LinkPeek – Hover. Peek. Decide.

**LinkPeek** is your new favorite Chrome extension that lets you **instantly preview links** without ever clicking them. Just hover over any link, and a smart little bubble appears — float over that, and *boom*, you’re peeking into the page right there, right then.

> 🎯 No more opening tabs. No more jumping back and forth. Just effortless, instant link previews.

## ✨ What Makes LinkPeek Special?

- 🧭 **Hover-to-Preview**  
  Surf the web like a pro. Hover on any link, then hover on the tiny bubble next to it to open a popup preview window — right inside your current tab.

- 🧠 **Google Search Superpower**  
  On search engines like Google, this becomes a game changer. Preview multiple results *without ever leaving the page*.

- 📏 **Resizable Windows**  
  Need more space? You got it. Just **drag from the bottom-right corner** of the preview popup to resize it the way you want.

- 🔄 **Save Time, Stay Focused**  
  Don’t get lost in a sea of tabs. Stay on the page you’re on, and only dive deeper when it’s worth it.

Some websites don’t allow their pages to be embedded in iframes (you might see a “refused to connect” error). That’s a limitation from those sites — nothing we can control. Most sites will work beautifully with LinkPeek!
